// Secret encapsulates information about the secret a task needs to proceed. An environment variable _FLYTE_SECRET_ENV_PREFIX will be passed to indicate the prefix of the environment variables that will be present if secrets are passed through environment variables. _FLYTE_SECRET_PATH_PREFIX will be passed to indicate the prefix of the path where secrets will be mounted if secrets are passed through file mounts.
type CoreSecret struct {
	// The name of the secret to mount. This has to match an existing secret in the system. It's up to the implementation of the secret management system to require case sensitivity.
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`
	// Type indicates the type of key requested. Asymmetric keys can not be passed through environment variables. If the underlying key management system cannot mount it through files, the task will fail.
