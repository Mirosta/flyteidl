// Tags are general key/value pairs associated with an Artifact. They can be used to search and filter things. Tags have to be unique by key for a given artifact. That is, for a given project/domain/name/version/key, there can only be one value, obviously.
type ArtifactTag struct {
	// tag types can be user specified if they want, though we'd probably recommend sticking with some constants that we embed in various libraries.
