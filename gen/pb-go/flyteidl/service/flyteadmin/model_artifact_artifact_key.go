type ArtifactArtifactKey struct {
	// Project and domain as we're all used to. Just to align with existing uniqueness constructs.
	Project string `json:"project,omitempty"`
	Domain string `json:"domain,omitempty"`
	// name can be auto-generated by the system in the case of natural outputs or un-named uploads or manually named by the user, if they care to. Please see the confluence doc for more discussion, this is one of the trickier bits of the design. Maybe we should always have an auto-generated string here and the user-facing \"name\" is a different field.
